# PRIME
PRIME (Probabilistic Regional Intolerance to Missense Estimation) is a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to measuring intolerance, or constraint, at a sub-genic level across coding regions of the genome. The model estimates the probability that a variant observed in the population is missense within a genomic region using gnomAD v4 exome and genome sequencing data. Regions under stronger purifying selection will have a lower probability, reflecting a depletion of their functional variants in the population. PRIME, via its beta-binomial hierarchical structure, induces a shrinkage effect on sub-genic estimates of intolerance by allowing them to be jointly informed by other regions in the same gene and other genes in the genome. This borrowing of information stabilizes estimates in regions with sparse variant counts. Additionally, the Bayesian framework yields marginal posterior distributions for each region, enabling principled quantification of uncertainty in the estimates.
